*GenericsObserver*

The class java.util.Observable and the interface java.util.Observer provide a simple framework for the
Observer/Observable pattern. However, these do not use Java generics as of JSE v7.

The purpose of this simple project is to provide an alternate, generics-based framework for the
Observable/Observer pattern. A simple test scenario (which can be considered a reference implementation)
is provided.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Especially any suggestions on how (and if) this should be proposed
as a JSR would be greatly appreciated.
